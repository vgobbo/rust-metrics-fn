# Function Metrics Codegen

**ATTENTION: Don't use this directly!**

This project is divided in a _build time_ module (this module), and a _runtime_ module (`metrics-fn`).

The runtime module includes this automatically, so you should pretty much ignore this.

See [metrics-fn](https://crates.io/crates/metrics-fn/) for more details.
